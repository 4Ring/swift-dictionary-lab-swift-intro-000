## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Make dictionaries
* Access elements in the dictionary
* Update the value with a key
* Recognize when they should use a dictionary


## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Optionals
* Just learned about dictionaries

## Outline / Notes

*  I like the idea of a harder problem (towards the end) asking them to have an array of strings be the value of keys that are of type String even though they would not have seen this yet.
* Here is an [example](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/swift-allAboutFunctions-lab/blob/mdippery/MyPlayground.playground/Pages/main.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift) of a playground project that includes questions about functions.
